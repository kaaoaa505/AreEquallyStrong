Call two arms equally strong, 

if the heaviest weights they each are able to lift are equal.

**Example**

- For yourLeft = 10, yourRight = 15, friendsLeft = 15 and friendsRight = 10, 

    - the output should be:

    - areEquallyStrong(yourLeft, yourRight, friendsLeft, friendsRight) = true;

- For yourLeft = 15, yourRight = 10, friendsLeft = 15 and friendsRight = 10,       

    - the output should be:

    - areEquallyStrong(yourLeft, yourRight, friendsLeft, friendsRight) = true;

- For yourLeft = 15, yourRight = 10, friendsLeft = 15 and friendsRight = 9,

    - the output should be: 

    - areEquallyStrong(yourLeft, yourRight, friendsLeft, friendsRight) = false.
